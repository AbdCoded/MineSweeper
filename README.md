INSTRUCTIONS

1-Left-click on any cell to start the game.

2-If the clicked cell contains a mine, you lose. The game ends.

3-If the clicked cell is safe, a number will appear, indicating the number of mines adjacent to that cell.

4-Use the numbers as clues to identify safe cells.

5-To help track potential mine locations, right-click on a cell to place a flag.

6-If you suspect a cell contains a mine but are unsure, you can mark it with a question mark by right-clicking again.

7-Analyze the numbers and patterns to make educated guesses about safe and mine-containing cells.

8-Continue left-clicking on safe cells to uncover more of the board.

9-Be cautious! Accidentally clicking on a cell containing a mine will end the game.

10-Repeat the above steps until you have flagged or uncovered all safe cells.

If you successfully uncover all safe cells without clicking on any mines, you win the game!
